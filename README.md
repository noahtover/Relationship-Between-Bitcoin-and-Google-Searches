# Relationship-Between-Bitcoin-and-Google-Searches
Bitcoin has no intrinsic value, as it produces no income other than capital gains. From this fact, I can assume that sentiment plays a greater role in determining price. One study from 2022 called Sentiment and Uncertainty says "The effects of uncertainty … are consistent with the view that higher uncertainty about fundamentals facilitates greater reliance on sentiment signals." (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X2200112X) I will be testing if an increase in search terms related to Bitcoin precede expected changes in Bitcoin's price, as an increase in positive or negative sentiment should mean a parallel change in price. Furthermore, I will be testing if the returns of Bitcoin during periods with extreme levels in sentiment - as defined by searches for "Sell Bitcoin" and "Buy Bitcoin" - are significantly different from returns during periods where there are regular periods of sentiment.
